<h1>Aullik's Adventure - The Definitive Aullik Video Game</h1>
<p>Developed in 25 days with Clickteam Fusion, a retro-style four-level game for Aullik's birthday, pushed out barely in time for March 25</p>
<p><b>Warning!</b> To make updates easier and ease of filesize, the game's download on its own plays real-time MIDI music which on normal systems and under Clickteam have horrible lag spikes every time the music is played or looped. It's highly recommended to download the rendered OGG music and extract it to the game folder so that the Music folder is next to the exe.</p>
<a href="Aullik's Adventure 1.4.5.zip"><p>15.1MB unpacked EXE download</a></p>
<a href="Aullik's Adventure Music.zip"><p>71.9MB OGG music download</a></p>

<b><p>v1.4.5 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li>Due to the separation of OGG music and the game itself, the game now plays MIDIs if there is no OGG music found.</li>
<li>Fix a weird bug where "play aullik" would send you one frame ahead idk how long it's been like this</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.4.4 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li><b>The game now plays rendered out OGG music instead of real-time MIDI!</b> This may sound like a negative on the surface, but on a regular system real-time MIDIs on Clickteam run horribly. OGG music lacks the lag spike each time the MIDI is loaded and looped, and can allow for proper resuming. The one downside is a substantial increase in filesize, but I think it's worth the performance boost.</li>
<li>Fix the keybinding in level 4</li>
<li>You can now change the keybindings for the reset and quit buttons</li>
<li>Retired the start-up MIDI setup screen as it's no longer necessary</li>
<li>The bonus pre-loader minigame now follows the custom keybindings</li>
<li>The in-game volume controls now actually change the volume of the game internally</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.4.3 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li>You can no longer submit a non-high score on level 4 if you go through the stats</li>
<li>The exit button was working on 1.4.1 but I broke it in 1.4.2 so it's working here</li>
<li>Added keybinding options</li>
<li>I added a sound effect if you get a high score!!!!!!!!!</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.4.2 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li>Fixed a bug where if you exit level 3 with a different cursor shape it doesn't change it back</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where if you play a sample and <i>then</i> a MIDI they both play at the same time in the soundtrack player</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where going to level 5 by the menu turns on the stats button</li>
<li>I found out the mixer extension I thought was used to change the MIDI's volume just changes the volume of the game from Windows itself and I couldn't find an alternative that actually changed the MIDI volume so I made it so that the samples aren't affected anymore which should balance out the sound effects and music if you change the volume</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.4.1 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li>Added a volume button and not a slider because the Trackbar extension betrayed me and wouldn't scale properly</li>
<li>The in-game scoreboards now account for the inflation instead of the game telling you to do it yourself</li>
<li>Added a stats feature to view your times and deaths on each zone of level 4</li>
<li>Replaced the level 3 music on Dreaming's Soundtrack with another song I like better</li>
<li>If you look in the source code I added another debug feature that destroys every enemy in level 4 except for the barriers</li>
<li>I found and replaced another instance of the old shittier pop-up extension</li>
<li>The exit button now works! (May do the opposite of exiting)</li>
<li>You can now actually exit the GameJolt account set-up screen and I also forgot to make the GameJolt icon visible</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.4 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li><b>Implemented four new leaderboards representing people who have died the least in levels!</b> I stayed up to code this</li>
<li>The game now saves your deaths and are now viewable in the bonuses</li>
<li>Replaced the pop-up message boxes extension with another one that actually works</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.3.5 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li>Fixed one (1) grammar mistake on the MIDI setup screen</li>
<li>Centered the text on the MIDI setup screen</li>
<li>Incredibly important update the game is now playable</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.3.4 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li>Added a secret key combination to instantly unlock the bonus menu! Guess what it is! Don't look in the source code please!</li>
<li>Hopefully fix the rich presence when restarting with F2 I can't really tell if it's fixed or broken in the first place</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.3.3 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li><b>Added full Discord rich presence support!</b> This is kinda buggy in some spots but I couldn't find proper documentation on this implementation of the API.</li>
<li>Added a button to exit a level at anytime to the menu (Z)</li>
<li>You can now exit the password screen</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.3.2 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li>Added a reset button (R)</li>
<li>Added an in-game timer to levels other than 2 when you start the game from the bonuses menu</li>
<li>You now have to press enter to continue from the level transition</li>
<li>Reverted the level 2 69 pellets jumpscare because that broke the whole thing</li>
<li>Beating level 4 now blasts more Lady Gaga</li>
<li>Changed the version number on the menu (the most important change)</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.3.1 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><li>Fixed a major bug where losing level 2 could result in getting a best time for level 1</li>
<li>You now get jumpscared when either side gets 69 or 696 pellets in level 2</li>
<li>The version number is now in the menu</li>
<li>Fixed the disable anti-aliasing switch turning on by itself</li>
<li>I was getting really bored so I just put in the Aullik's Adventure Online pre-loader minigame as a bonus</li></ul>

<b><p>v1.3 Changelog</p></b>
<ul><b><li>Implemented a fully working online leaderboard system!</b> The reason 1.3 took two days to develop is because I was trying to find a working method for this. My last resort was GameJolt because it required an account, and unfortunately I did have to resort to this. <a href="https://gamejolt.com">You can quickly go here if you'd like to sign up.</a></li>
<li>Fixed a major bug where your best times were calculated as your worst times</li>
<li>Updated the Level 5 credits</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in two levels where the timer's minutes were split depending on the amount of time passed instead of the actual seconds counted (it did only prove to be an issue in level 3 where the explosion brings you to another frame)</li>
<li>Turned on anti-aliasing</li>
<li>You actually get asked if you'd like to reset your save file or best times now</li>
<li>Pillarboxing borders are now black</li>
<li>For some reason there was an unused regular Ini object in the MIDI test frame that has been deleted because the actual game uses Ini++</ul></p>

<h1>Aullik's Adventure Online - An Inferior But More Convenient Experience</h1>
<p>Spontaneously ported to HTML5 on August 6</p>
<p>Due to technical troubles with the Clickteam extensions used not supporting HTML5, saving is disabled and level 2 had to get <i>fucked</i> up. I'd highly recommend against playing this unless you do not have a platform to play the PC version on.</p>
<p>Based on 1.2.1, this likely won't be updated unless I find out about a near game-breaking bug that would also affect this version.</p>
<a href="./online/"><p>No idea how big the download for this one is, but I did code a fun little preloader minigame</a></p>

<h1>Shiro Dropped His Gift Card - An Infinitely Worse Prequel</h1>
<p>A year before the face of planet Earth saw the birth of Aullik's Adventure, they had to stick with this shitty 2-minute point and click for their fix of Aullik</p>
<p>I think the full title is "oh no! shiro sdropped his 20 dollar steam gift card and now aullik must go find shiro 20 dollar steam gift card that aullik shiro droppd!!!!: a point and click adventure" but I don't like this enough to care.</p>
<a href="Shiro Dropped His Gift Card.exe"><p>19.9MB packed EXE download</a></p>
